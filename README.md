## Notes

- I'm very new with Javascript.
- I did not know the difference betwwen ReactJS and React-Native. I watched a series Teaching React-Native on youtube. After that, I saw the project created by doing http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac is not same with React-Native project. After asking my friend, I recognized the problem.
